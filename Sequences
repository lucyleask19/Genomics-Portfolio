Lists are created with square brackets and can contain any mix of values (numbers and letters), and the element numbering starts at 0

  (min(list)) finds the minimum
  (max(list)) finds the maximum
  len(list) gives the number of elements within the list
Square brackets finds a specific item; list[3] finds the third item
Square brackets with a colon finds a specific portion of a list, list[1:4]


Ranges are sequences of numbers

  range(limit) gives the range of whole numbers from 0 up to but not including 'limit'
  range(start, limit) gives the range of numbers from 'start' up to but not including 'limit'
  range(start, limit, step) gives the range of every 'step' number from 'start' up to but not including 'limit'



Input function can be used to allow the program to get data from the user by pausing and waiting for something to be typed and entered

  name =  input('Enter your name: ')

The variable will always be stored as a string, even numbers.
Therefore, if working with numbers, input needs to be converted 

  age = int(input('How old are you? '))



For command is used to repeat code for each item in a sequence by looping
  
for x in sequence:
    print(x)

Loop can be used to generate components of a list, numbers within a range, and even characters within a string
