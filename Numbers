Numbers within python can be represented as a normal number or as text.   
There are two types of numbers: integers and floating point numbers (floats). 
Integers are whole numbers and floats are numbers with a decimal point.
Text values are termed strings, which are sequences of characters defined by quotation marks. 
Most variables are inserted to code as a text, and therefore must be converted to a number using the following commands

  variable = "1234.78"

  variable_as_integer = int(variable)
    print(variable_as_integer) 

  variable_as_float = float(variable)
    print(variable_as_float)

  float_rounded = round(variable_as_float, 1) 
    print(float_rounded) #float value is rounded to 1 decimal


Float conversion can be used to convert scientific notation (where e means 'x10 to the power of') to a fully expressed value

  scientific_text = "1.234e2"
  scientific_value = float(scientific_text)
    print(scientific_value)


The string command is used to convert an integer (or float) value into text representation.
Numbers have to be text in order to be combinded into a string with other characters, usually letters

  sentence = 'the value is' + str(variable_as_integer)
    print(sentence)


Operations on numbers (addition, multiplication, joining strings together) are dependant on the format of the variables (e.g. text or integer)
Running 1+1 gives you 2, whereas runnning "1" + "test" gives you '1test'
