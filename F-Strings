F strings allow the insertion of different variables into a string in a clean and readable way
This means that even if the value of the variable changes, the string can still be printed correcrtly

  hindex = 23.5
  firstname = 'Jo'
  lastname = 'Jones'
  age = '35'

  biographic = f"{firstname} {lastname} ({age}) has a H-index of {hindex}"
    print(biographic)
